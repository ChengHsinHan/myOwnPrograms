# Escape the room
# You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash
# table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be
# at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three
# properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

rooms = {
    '0': {"name": None, "description": None, "completed": None},
    '1': {"name": None, "description": None, "completed": None},
    '2': {"name": None, "description": None, "completed": None},
}
