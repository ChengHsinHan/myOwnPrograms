# Welcome  
Welcome to Cheng-Hsin Han's CodeWars solutions GitHub!  
This page is only for those who are struggling to figure out a solution but in vain  
or those who want to check out others' solutions and is non-profit.  

The following are the rules for this page.  

## Languages
1. The languages written are
  * Python
  * C
  * C++
2. Different languages are categorized in different directories.
3. Any new languages will (probably) be included in the future, as long as the author decides to learn one.
---
## File Names
1. The file names are numbered, starting with the "#" symbol.
2. The numbers are sorted by the time the author tries the kata, not by the difficulties or personal preference.
3. The rest of file names are directly copied from the original kata names, without invalid characters.
---
## File Content
1. Kata descriptions are included from the beginning of each file and commented out.
2. Any figure that cannot be included are omitted.
3. Mathematical formulas are adjusted in the way that is readable in a line.
4. Any comments that is related to the kata written by the kata owner are kept, the others are discarded.
---
## Coding Styles
### Indentation Conventions
1. For Python, the indentation for each block is set to one tab.
2. For C/C++, Allman's style is adopted, with each indentation set to one tab as well.
### Naming Conventions
1. Parameter names are kept intact, except for some rare cases where parameter names are not provided.
In that case, a suitable name would be given to the parameters.
2. The variable names created by the author will follow the kata owner's conventions.
i.e. If the kata owner uses camelCase to name the parameters, so would the variables.
However, if both cases appeared in the same kata, snake_case would be adopted for Python, and camelCase would be used in C/C++.
3. Variables are named in the most suggested way... well, the author would try his best to do so.
### Performance
1. The time complexity of the solution is aiming for the most optimal ones.
2. The space consuption is aiming for the minimal but not nitpicking ones.
3. Comments are only used for sophisticated algorithms.

If you find any any mistakes that contradict the rules stated above, or any new suggestions for the rules, you can contact me
via my GitHub website or send an e-mail to me.  
Thanks for reading this, and I will be reviewing / writing new solutions for the katas.
